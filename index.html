                   <p>Knowing what your purpose is, is truly a gift. Unfortunately, finding my purpose for me, has always been challenging until....I discovered Engineering in the Tech World.<br> <br>I was born in a small town, in Colorado, and raised in the state of Arizona. As a kid, I was always a very determined person and obsessive by nature. Having these 2 personality traits have helped me accomplish many things.<br><br>There are many things I like to do on my free time. I am a huge advocate for fitness, and love to weight train. I will admit though, I love junk food too. Love playing the drums and guitar as well. Reading books has been a hobby of mine also. My absolute favorite thing to do is ride my Motorcycle, I absolutely love the thrill!<br><br>I graduated from DevMountain, specializing in Python, but learned many other things as well. Programming is so rewarding, I love putting my mind to the test and problem solving, it is very stimulating, which is why I love programming!<br><br>Utilizing my training and knowledge provided by DevMountain, as well as the constant need to challenge myself, I am confident that I will accomplish many great things in the field of coding. Look forward to working with you!</p>
